## Alternative: Restart PowerShell and Try Git

If you want to use Git command line instead:

1. **Close this PowerShell window**
2. **Open a NEW PowerShell window**
3. **Navigate to project:**
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\kamal\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\tech-learning-platform
   ```
4. **Run:**
   ```powershell
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added video tutorials and clickable navigation"
   git push origin main
   ```

The PATH environment variable updates after Git installation but requires a new terminal session.
